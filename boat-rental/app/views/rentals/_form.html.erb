### PART 2A - Build rental form - associate rental to customer and boat
* This Form should allow you to choose an EXISTING boat and create a NEW customer
* Make this form a partial so that it can be used to edit the Rental also
* Prove the form works without making any views to display the data. Instead, use the Rails Console and Pry
*  Bonus: Add server validations and display them in form
